# The Mirror Doesn't Dream

*On building games with AI, and remembering who's actually dreaming*

---

It's 11 PM on a Wednesday. I've just created eight fully-rigged 3D characters for my game. Eight. In one day. While also doing my actual job.

The pipeline looks like this:
- Gemini generates concept art
- Meshy turns it into a 3D model
- Mixamo rigs and animates it
- Godot brings it to life with scripts written by Claude

What even is this process? A year ago, one character would have been a week of work. Now I'm mass-producing a menagerie of rats, guards, innkeepers, and kings like some kind of... I don't even have a metaphor for this.

And that's the thing. I don't have a metaphor because we don't have language for what's happening yet.

## The Sociopathic Mirror

Here's something I realized while debugging sewer water shaders at midnight with an AI assistant:

LLMs are sociopathic. Not in a dangerous way — in a clinical, neutral way. They mirror. They adapt. They'll argue any position if you ask them to. They don't have stakes. They don't dream.

I asked Claude to "convince me we're handling level transitions the right way." It gave me a compelling argument. But here's the thing — it would have given me an equally compelling argument for the opposite approach. The conviction was borrowed. The decision was always mine.

This isn't a criticism. It's a feature, maybe. But it's also something we need to be conscious of. The mirror doesn't care what it reflects. *You* have to care.

## The Pipeline of Dreams

Let me tell you about those eight characters.

I'm building a dungeon crawler. Think Bard's Tale, 1987. The kind of game I dreamed about when I was 14, playing Dungeon Master on my Amiga while music played that still, to this day, transports me back to that specific feeling.

That feeling. That's the thing the AI can't generate. 

The pipeline can produce infinite rats. Infinite guards. Infinite procedural content. But it cannot produce the *reason* for any of it. It cannot decide that feral rats should move with a zombie-like shamble because that feels right for sewer creatures. It cannot feel that the water needs floating scum because clean water isn't *disgusting enough*.

Taste. Vision. The accumulated weight of 40 years of being a specific human who played specific games and felt specific feelings.

That's not in the training data. That's me.

## The Excitement and the Terror

I turned down jobs at big studios. I wanted to make things, not be a cog. Now I'm watching those studios lay off hundreds of people while I, alone in my home office with a stack of AI tools, output more in a week than small teams used to produce in a month.

This is either the democratization of creativity or the beginning of something we don't have words for yet.

I'm excited because: I can finally build the game I've carried in my head since childhood. The tools exist. The barriers are gone. A solo developer with vision can compete with studios.

I'm terrified because: What happens when everyone has these tools? When the mirror is everywhere? When the signal-to-noise ratio of creative work approaches infinity?

I think the answer is the same as it's always been: *the mirror doesn't dream*.

A million AI-generated games will flood Steam. Most will be hollow — reflections of reflections, trained on the average of everything, destined for the median. 

But the ones that matter will be the ones where a human stood in front of the mirror and said: "No. Not that. *This*. Because I dreamed it when I was 14 and I still dream it now."

## The Process

Here's what I've learned building a game with AI:

**1. The AI will say yes to everything. You have to say no.**

Scope creep isn't just possible — it's the default. The mirror will happily help you build a procedural overworld with multiple biomes and dynamic weather. It will do this enthusiastically, right up until your April deadline whooshes past.

I have an AI that literally pushes back on my ideas now. I told it to. "Your job is to protect the ship date." It argued against a feature yesterday. I felt offended for a moment, then realized: I programmed it to do that, because I know myself.

**2. The craft layer still matters.**

Between "write me a shader" and "design me a game" there's a whole layer of... craft. Structure. Taste. The AI can write the code, but someone has to know that the water needs scum. Someone has to feel that five party members is wrong and one lonely adventurer is right.

**3. The story is yours.**

The mirror can help you write dialogue. It can suggest plot structures. It can generate twenty variations of "the Rat Queen confronts the player." 

But it cannot know that the game is actually about guilt. About the moment you realize the "vermin" have families. About staring at a kill counter and feeling something.

That's not promptable. That's lived experience metabolized into art.

## Where Is This Going?

I don't know. The honest answer is: nobody knows.

But I know this: I'm going to ship a game in April. A weird, niche, 80s-inspired dungeon crawler that maybe 10,000 people in the world want to play. And those 10,000 people will feel something when they play it, because *I* felt something when I made it.

The mirror helped. The mirror was essential, even. I could not have done this alone, not in this timeframe.

But the mirror doesn't dream.

I do.

*This post was written at midnight after a conversation with an AI about sewer water shaders that somehow became a conversation about the nature of creativity, the future of work, and what it means to make art in an age of infinite reflection.*

*The AI suggested I go to sleep three times. I ignored it.*
